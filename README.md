# Classification-of-Diabetic-Retinopathy-using-Deep-Learning
In diabetic individuals, blockages, lesions, or bleeding in the retina's light-sensitive region can produce diabetic retinopathy, an ophthalmological condition. An rise in blood sugar induces an increase in blood vessel blockage, which results in new vessel growth that gives birth to mesh-like structures. To provide a precise diagnosis, ophthalmologists must evaluate the branching retinal vasculature. Segmentation comes after the pre-processing of the fundus scans of the eye.
Any feature extraction operator will work for segmentation. We utilized a ResNet model to train the classifier for categorization, and then SVM for classification.To assess the effectiveness of the suggested approach, we use the DIARETDB1 (standard Diabetic Retinopathy Dataset) and a dataset supplied by a medical facility that contains fundus images of both defective and normal retinas. MATLAB is used to complete the entire project.
